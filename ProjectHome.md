I've decided to release CrNote to the community as opensource due to time constraints on being able to achieve regular feature enhancements, and hopefully someone out there is interested in contributing to the project.  The application is released under the GPL and any builds will be released as a free product on the Android play store.

Currently released on Google Play at
